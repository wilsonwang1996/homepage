    <h2><a class="page-hyperlink" href="public/data/documents/Eisenberg.pdf">1. Research on bank systemic risk</a></h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Research objective:</h3> Model how systemic risks transmit through bank systems</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Research type:</h3> Independent research paid with credit, organized by Professor Zachary Feinstein in WashU,
    worked
    independently and reported to professor once a week</p>
    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read research papers about bank default risk. I used their mathematical methods to solve non-linear systems
            and calculated clearing vectors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set up the model in MATLAB using object-oriented programming, and gradually added features to the model,
            such as
            extension of debts and the settlement of transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optimized the run-time and further expanded the model so it simulated bank behaviors over time and can thus
            use time series to track financial system evolvement.
        </li>
        <li>
            Created and then implemented the idea where I applied the model to standard simulated bank systems. I
            generated
            cases where banks form unions, set up branches, or establish stratified structures where central banks
            ensure
            economic stability of regional financial networks. Then, I simulated bank defaults and systematic economic
            shocks to test the financial sustainability.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a class="page-hyperlink" href="https://github.com/wilsonwang1996/glassdoor">2. Research on business strategy</a></h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Research objective:</h3> Analyze industry and company strategies through public information.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Research type:</h3> Independent research paid with money, organized by Professor Ulya Tsolmon, worked
    independently
    and reported to professor once per week during semester and multiple times a day during summer</p>
    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed robots to collect information on websites, such as Glassdoor and SeekingAlpha. The robots can login
            as VIP and scrap on multiple websites at the same time. They worked best with computing cloud where I used
            WashUâ€™s medical school server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Did data management through Python and VBA. The scripts extracted useful information from raw data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used machine learning tools such as Rapidminer and BIWS on the collected user reviews and call transcript.
            The
            idea was to connect linguistic information with CEOs and analysts.
        </li>
        <li>
            By connecting CEO and analyst personality, originality, review to the company, I generated data regarding
            corporation culture and management style.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a class="page-hyperlink" href="public/data/documents/city_clusters.pdf">3. Research on industry and international policy</a></h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Research objective:</h3> Analyze economic condition and industry development.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Research type:</h3> Unpaid research at CITICS Securities, directed by Doctor Yunsheng Leng, reported directly to
    Fan
    Yang and Bin Liu.</p>
    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read both research papers, government documents, and news about global city clusters and new energy
            vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Audited channel checks and keep track of valuable public and not-so-public information.
        </li>
        <li>
            Studied about stock ownership structures for related companies and generate research report supporting the
            trading department.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a class="page-hyperlink" href="projects/child_development">4. Project on information visualization</a></h2>
    <p>
    <h3>Research objective:</h3> Effectively present research results in user-friendly interactive ways.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Research type:</h3> Credited project, directed by Professor Alvitta Ottley, worked very interactively with
    Kaitlyn
    Holzer (student at WashU).</p>
    <h3>What I did:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Did some research on linguistics regarding cultural differences and child development. I used technics from
            my
            business strategy research.
        </li>
        <li>
            Designed visualization in Javascript and D3. The work of Kait and I won the applause of many users. It is
            more
            concise to show it in the links below than to describe it verbally.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5. Some cool or entertaining projects</h2>
    <h3><a class="page-hyperlink" href="public/data/documents/CapSim.PDF">Capital market simulation competition:</a></h3>
    <p>Capsim winner team, industry leader. I led a simulated market team where students generated marketing strategies
        related to supply chain and financial tools. Through group effort we won first position in the simulated trading
        game. In my master program, I will actively join any kind of such competition because I want to test my ability
        to do well and work with teams, and I like to get attention for my achievement.</p>
    <h3><a class="page-hyperlink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/imdb-api">Mobile app design:</a></h3>
    <p>With four other students, I designed an app on iOS 7 where people can check film details and find their ratings.
        The app is connected to iMDb film database. Unfortunately, my team decided not to provide links to free online
        streaming websites, but the app could potentially allow users to watch movies for free if we have implemented
        that feature. Although application development is only a very conditional hobby of mine and not within my career
        plans, I have learned how to design usable mobile applications and can do so if there is urgent need in projects
        or work.</p>
    <h3><a class="page-hyperlink" href="projects/humor">Humor Writing Study</a></h3>
    <p>I'm interested in modern humor literature. In Professor McPherson's class, I gave a speech about my understanding
        of modern humor, and pitched about how I used big data and machine learning methods to examine the modern humor.
        I talked about the possibility that computers will be able to detect humor and the potential barriers. I also
        showed my collected data in an user-friendly interactive way so that the students could discuss about the matter
        during the class. I intend to keep doing this project and share my results with Professor McPherson.</p>
