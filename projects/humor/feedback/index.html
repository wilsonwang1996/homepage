<p>
    Thanks for being here. In the "show and tell" next class, we will be looking at some rudimentary linguistic factors
    in humor literature and discuss about them. Moreover, we will compare different genres. We have gone through many
    pieces over the semester, so to contribute to our discussion you may refer to any piece we have read in class. You
    can also give me the URL of your favorite piece (or send the piece to me).
</p>
<h3>
    Below is a questionnaire that we will discuss some issues in class based on the feedback.
</h3>

<form action="https://formspree.io/wilson.wang@wustl.edu" method="POST"/>
First name:<br>
<input type="text" name="firstname" value=""><br>
Last name:<br>
<input type="text" name="lastname" value=""><br><br>
<p>
    Q: Would you allow us to use your work in statistical database? We may look at the linguistic factors in a
    collection
    and student essays?
</p>
<input type="radio" name="authorization" value="yes" checked> Yes, I want my piece to be discussed in class and analyzed
by classmates<br>
<input type="radio" name="authorization" value="yes-limited"> Yes, I want to contribute to the class content by having
my piece in database, but I don't want any class discussion about it <br>
<input type="radio" name="authorization" value="no-limited"> No, my piece can be in database but I want to be
anonymous<br>
<input type="radio" name="authorization" value="no"> No, don't involve me in this activity<br>

<p>
    Q: What would you say to be factors to take into account into determining the genres of a humor literature? you can
    list linguistic factors such as: affection, anger, confusion, lust. You may choose to talk about a few humor
    literature genres of your choice and expand on how strong each category of humor may behave strong in some
    linguistic factors. Your response here is crucial and will impact our coming class discussion topic.

<textarea name="linguistic-factor" rows="3" cols="80"></textarea>

    Q: If you haven't submitted a "show and tell" piece, or class manuscript, or if you have a piece of humor literature
    you wish to our database, please paste the URL here. Alternatively, you can paste the whole essay (or part of it)
    into the box below. Your personal piece will be classified as "humor literature by WUSTL students", and professional
    pieces will be classified as "humor literature from internet society". For this section, generally we prefer longer
    pieces (at least 800 words), since the statistical data generated by lexicon program would be more reliable. (Less
    outliers as in prob and stats)
