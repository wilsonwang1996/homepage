<p>Humor is a fascinating magic we implemented into our day-to-day conversation and writing. When it comes to
    literature, things get complex here because of the variety of genres and techniques available.</p>
<p>Let's look at some online humor</p>

<p>Q: What would you say to be factors to take into account into determining the genres of a humor literature?</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>I think certain words are important for humor, some that are heard not often or maybe swear words in an unexpected
    setting.</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>Some factors that make a piece funny would be hyperbole, emotion, metaphor/simile, and anecdote. In the Buzzfeed
    article, things that make those tweets funny would also be cultural references and slang. One of my favorite pieces
    we read this semester was the "Black Guy Asks a Nation for Change" piece from The Onion. As a satirical piece, one
    of the things that made it funny was that it uses a part of popular culture/historical events and satirizes them â€“
    you recognize instantly what it satirizes when you read it based on your own experiences and knowledge of culture. I
    also enjoy humor that parodies, because it's fun to recognize what the work is referencing.</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>
    I think several criteria are important: first of all, the form (parody, satire etc.). The silliness/absurdity levels
    are important in classification. The overall seriousness/emotional valence is important too.
</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>
    I think one very important factor that determines genre of humor literature is sarcasm. Pieces without sarcasm are
    usually more straightforward and it is easier to tell when there are jokes. Pieces with sarcasm usually have two
    layers of meaning and may at first appear to be in favor of something when actually they are against it. Pieces in
    the satire and parody genres of humor literature definitely have a lot more sarcasm used than in genres such as
    observational or imagined scenario.
</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>
    -Personal essays generally include more emotional details, more description/explanation, and are longer, due to the
    storytelling form
    -Satires sometimes use more extreme language, since they are trying to make an argument about something
    -Parodies vary a lot depending on the style, but, for example, could use more formal language if parodying a more
    formal type of writing
</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>
    I think that it is important to take into account confusion when reading humor pieces. Depending on the audience, a
    piece could cause confusion because they might not understand the piece's conceit if they don't have the right
    context.

<p>Class Discussion:</p>
<p>1. Can we discover humor by examine certain patterns in it?</p>
<p>2. Do you think a robot can recognize jokes?</p>
<p>3. What are types of humor that you can't perceive a nonhuman would come up with?</p>
