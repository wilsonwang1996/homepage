sorry hitting wrong hope okay
hope grownup tooth grows fast mine always
thank much letter one thing ive learned middleschool
director twenty year almost always two side every story
although dont know detail inkling may sparked
confrontation julian
nothing justifies striking another studentâever âi also know good friend
sometimes worth defending tough year lot student
first year middle school usually
keep good work keep fine boy know
spoke amanda john yesterday expressed regret jack
punched son julian mouth writing let know
husband support decision allow jack return beecher prep
twoday suspension although think hitting child would valid ground
expulsion school agree extreme measure arent warranted
known family since boy kindergarten confident
every measure taken ensure doesnt happen
end wonder jack unexpectedly violent behavior might result
much pressure placed young shoulder speaking specifically
new child special need jack julian asked befriend
retrospect seen child question various school function
class picture think may much ask child
able process certainly julian mentioned hard time
befriending boy told hook regard think
transition middle school hard enough without place greater burden
hardship young impressionable mind also mention
member school board little disturbed consideration
given child application process fact beecher prep
inclusion school many parentsâmyself includedâwho question decision
let child school least somewhat troubled
child held stringent application standard ie interview
rest incoming middleschool student
thanks email outlining concern convinced jack
extremely sorry action confident would repeat
action rest assured would allowing back beecher prep
concern regarding new student august please note
special need neither disabled handicapped
developmentally delayed way reason assume anyone would
take issue admittance beecher prepâwhether inclusion school
term application process admission director felt within
right hold interview offsite august home reason obvious
felt slight break protocol warranted way prejudicialâin
one way anotherâto application review august extremely good student
secured friendship truly exceptional young people including jack
""
beginning school year enlisted certain child welcoming
committee august way easing transition school
environment think asking child especially kind new student
would place extra burden hardship fact thought would teach
thing two empathy friendship loyalty
turn jack didnt need learn virtuesâhe already
abundance
thank touch

dental bill
