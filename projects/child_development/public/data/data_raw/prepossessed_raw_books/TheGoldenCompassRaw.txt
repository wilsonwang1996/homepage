board turn loses ill die dont care
win well send lee scoresby ill sail away
balloon
who lee scoresby
aeronaut brought u crashed
here alethiometer good order
made move take laid brass fender around
hearth
suppose ought tell mr coulter way
svalbard soon hears whats happened lofur raknison
shell way zeppelin whole lot soldier
theyre going kill u order magisterium
theyll never reach u said calmly
quiet relaxed ferocity dwindled
dont know said uncertainly
yes
got another alethiometer
dont need alethiometer want hear
journey lyra start beginning tell everything
began hiding retiring room went
gobbler taking roger time mr coulter
everything else happened
long tale finished said there one
thing want know reckon ive got right know like
right know really didnt tell
youve got tell recompense whats dust
why everyone afraid
looked trying guess whether would understand
say never looked seriously
thought always like adult indulging
child pretty trick seemed think ready
dust make alethiometer work said ahi thought
might else find
one way church always aware theyve
preaching dust century didnt call
name
year ago muscovite called boris mikhailovitch rusakov
discovered new kind elementary particle youve heard
electron photon neutrino rest theyre called elementary
particle cant break there
nothing inside well new kind particle
elementary right hard measure didnt
react usual way hardest thing rusakov
understand new particle seemed cluster human
being attracted u especially adult
child nearly much daemon taken
fixed form year puberty begin attract dust
strongly settle settle adult
discovery sort bearing
doctrine church announced magisterium
geneva discovery rusakovs unlikely strange
inspector consistorial court discipline suspected
rusakov diabolic possession performed exorcism
laboratory interrogated rusakov rule inquisition
finally accept fact rusakov wasnt lying
deceiving dust really existed
left problem deciding given
church nature one thing could chosen
magisterium decided dust physical evidence original
sin know original sin
twisted lip like back jordan quizzed
something shed halftaught sort said
dont go shelf beside desk bring
bible
lyra handed big black book father
remember story adam eve
course said wasnt supposed eat fruit
serpent tempted
happened
ummthey thrown god threw garden
god told eat fruit would die
remember naked garden like child
daemon took form desired happened
turned chapter three genesis read
woman said unto serpent may eat fruit
tree garden
fruit tree midst garden god
hath said ye shall eat neither shall ye touch lest ye
die
serpent said unto woman ye shall surely die
god doth know day ye eat thereof eye shall
opened daemon shall assume true form ye shall
god knowing good evil
woman saw tree good food
pleasant eye tree desired reveal true
form one daemon took fruit thereof eat
gave also unto husband eat
eye opened saw true form
daemon spoke
man woman knew daemon knew
great change come upon moment seemed
one creature earth air difference
saw difference knew good evil
ashamed sewed fig leaf together cover
nakedness
closed book
sin came world said sin shame
death came moment daemon became fixed
lyra struggled find word wanted ent
true true like chemistry engineering kind
true wasnt really adam eve cassington scholar told
kind fairy tale
cassington scholarship traditionally given freethinker
function challenge faith scholar naturally
hed say think adam eve like imaginary number like
square root minus one never see concrete proof
exists include equation calculate
manner thing couldnt imagined without
anyway church taught thousand year
rusakov discovered dust last physical proof
something happened innocence changed experience
incidentally bible gave u name dust well first
called rusakov particle soon someone pointed curious
verse toward end third chapter genesis god
cursing adam eating fruit
opened bible pointed lyra read
sweat thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto
ground wast thou taken dust thou art unto
dust shalt thou return
lord asriel said church scholar always puzzled
translation verse say read unto dust shalt
thou return thou shalt subject dust others say
whole verse kind pun word ground dust
really mean god admitting nature partly sinful
one agrees one text corrupt
good word waste thats particle became known
dust
gobbler lyra said
general oblation boardyour mother gang clever spot
chance setting power base shes clever woman
dare say youve noticed suit magisterium allow
kind different agency flourish play
one another one succeeds pretend supporting
along fails pretend renegade
outfit never properly licensed
see mother always ambitious power first
tried get normal way marriage didnt
work think youve heard turn church
naturally couldnt take route man could takenpriesthood
onit unorthodox set order
channel influence work good move
specialize dust everyone frightened one knew
offered direct investigation magisterium
relieved backed money resource
kind
cutting lyra couldnt bring say
word choked mouth know
church let anything like
precedent something like happened
know word castration mean mean removing sexual
organ boy never develops characteristic man
castrate keep high treble voice life
church allowed useful church music castrato became
great singer wonderful artist many became fat spoiled halfmen
died effect operation church
wouldnt flinch idea little cut see
precedent would much hygienic old
method didnt anesthetic sterile bandage
proper nursing care would gentle comparison
isnt lyra said fiercely isnt
course thats hide away far north
darkness obscurity church glad someone
like mother charge could doubt someone charming
wellconnected sweet reasonable obscure
unofficial kind operation someone magisterium could
deny needed well
whose idea cutting first place
guessed two thing happen
adolescence might connected change one daemon fact
dust began settle perhaps daemon separated
body might never subject dustto original sin
question whether possible separate daemon body
without killing person shes traveled many place seen
kind thing shes traveled africa instancethe
african way making slave called zombi
work day night without ever running away
complaining look like corpse
person without daemon
exactly found possible separate
andtony costa told horrible phantom
northern forest suppose might kind thing
thats right anyway general oblation board grew idea
like church obsession original sin
lord asriels daemon twitched ear laid hand
beautiful head
something else happened made cut
went didnt see energy link body daemon
immensely powerful cut made energy dissipates
fraction second didnt notice mistook
shock disgust moral outrage trained
feel numb towards missed could never
thought harnessing
lyra couldnt sit still got walked window
stared wide bleak darkness unseeing eye
cruel matter important find original sin
cruel theyd done tony makarios
others nothing justified
said cutting
im interested something quite different dont think
oblation board go far enough want go source dust
