night
tired hopeful since left island good weather change would cover
many league dark another night another day might bring within sight shore towards

long dawn thinking strange place would look like canoe began leak
crack plank larger one close kneeling
fibre tore skirt pushed crack held back water seeped whenever canoe rose
fell wave yet could see plank weak one end probably canoe
stored long sun might open along whole length wave grew rougher suddenly clear
dangerous go voyage would take two day perhaps longer turning back island
would neatly far travel
still could make mind sea calm come far thought running back
labour could bear even greater thought deserted island would return living alone
forgotten many sun many moon
canoe drifted idly calm sea thought went mind saw water seeping
crack picked paddle choice except turn back towards island
knew best fortune would ever reach
wind blow sun head time covered good distance pausing
necessary dip water canoe wind went slowly stop often water
spilling side leak grow worse
first good fortune next swarm dolphin appeared came swimming west
saw canoe turned around great circle began follow swam slowly close
could see eye large colour ocean swam ahead canoe crossing back
forth front diving weaving piece cloth broad snout
dolphin animal good omen made happy swimming around canoe though hand
begun bleed chafing paddle watching made forget pain lonely
appeared felt friend feel
blue dolphin left shortly dusk left quickly come going west long
time could see last sun shining night fell could still see thought
kept paddling wanted lie sleep
anything blue dolphin took back home
fog came night yet time time could see star stand high west red star called magat

needed place sheltered wind far coral cove close good spring two
place island one headland le league west headland seemed
favourable two since long time decided go make certain
first thing found forgotten place near wild dog lair soon drew near
leader came opening cave watched yellow eye built hut would first kill
pack planned anyway would take much time
spring better one near head land le brackish steadier flow water besides
much easier reach since came side hill ravine one also close
cliff ridge rock would shelter house
rock high head land therefore would give le protection wind yet
high enough could see north coast coral cove
thing made decide place build house sea elephant

elephant could crawl halfway cliff day stormy fair day could fish among pool
lie rock
bull large often weighs much thirty men cow much smaller make noise
bull screaming barking whole day sometimes night baby noisy

another place south could built house near destroyed village ghalasat
want go would remind people gone also wind blew strong place blowing
dune cover middle part island time sand moving every
rain fell night lasted two day made shelter brush foot rock kept water
ate food stored basket could build fire rain cold
third day rain ceased went look thing would need building house likewise needed
