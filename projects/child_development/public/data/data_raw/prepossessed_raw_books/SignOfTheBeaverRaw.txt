skipping page sounded like sermon matt chose section liked best came rescue man friday attean sat quietly matt almost forgot enjoyment favorite scene
mysterious footprint sand canoe drawn lonely beach strange wildlooking men two captive one captive mercilessly slaughtered fire set blazing cannibal feast
