purpose
pushed open heavy pipework
door stepped inside air smelled
strongly dampness moldy rubber
seemed pleasant
interesting smell strode hallway
yellow slicker hung peg
wall end hallway
room full people sitting
bench pulling kneehigh
rubber boot struggling
slicker buckling tool belt
raucous clamor filled room doon
watched doorway eager join
sure
moment man emerged
throng thrust hand lister munk
