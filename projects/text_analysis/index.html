    <h1>Analysis of Fairy Tales Across Cultures</h1>
    <h4 class="author-info"> By Wilson(Wei) Wang, Email: wilson.wang@wustl.edu, School ID: 435204</h4>
    <p>
        In this graphical report, I aim to explore the difference and similarities between fairy tales of different
        nationalities. For this topic, I choose three different fairy tale books containing English, Russian, and Indian
        fairy tales. As a simple model of world fairy tales, the English one in my case would represent Western/US fairy
        tales; the Russian one represents Eastern European tales; the Indian one represents Asian tales.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Problems to solve:
    </h3>
    <p>
        1. Analyze the frequencies of most common words by TF-IDF. This will give a direct image of cultural word usage
        of
        fairy tales of various origin.<br/>
        2. Analyze linguistic dimensionality of regional fairy tales. The axis will be colored in a heat decadency order
        reflecting levels of sentiment. The data will then be represented by Parallel Coordinates, which allows
        comparison between sentiments in fairy tales from different backgrounds. I was inspired to create draggable axis
        by blo.ck <br/>
        3. Analyze the linguistic vectors of regional fairy tales. This serves as an extension to linguistic
        dimensionality.
        For example, some statistics alone do not reflect statistical meaningful results. However, the ratio between
        stats
        may provide interest and insight for data science. This part allows the users to better comprehend the
        difference
        and similarity between national fairy tales, given their vectors of composition.

            I. TF-IDF Analysis
        </h2>
        <p>
            First analyze words of highest TF-IDF as they are considered "the most important words" in the
            fairy tale word sets. I will use a babble graph to show the most common words in the graph. The size of the
            babbles represent the relative importance of the words. The color heat of the words represent the word
            length, as longer words are "hotter". On the right of each babble graph is the interpretation of the data.

                English TD-IDF Analysis
            </h3>
            <p>
                Looking at the high TF-IDF words in the English fairy tales, we can see that most of the words are of
                the length 3 or 4, which correspond to the color "light blue" and "grey". This is largely due to the
                audiences of the English fairy tales are kids. Noticably we can see that the average word length (thus
                average heat of the color of circles) here is relatively low compared to fairy tales from Russia or
                India. This is probably due to that the other stories are usually translated and simople words in
                foreign languages may or may be be easily expressed in English during translation.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing noticeable is that English fairy tales are obsessed with using the name "Jack", and they
                usually prefer "cat" then "dog" in their stories.

                Russian TD-IDF Analysis
            </h3>
            <p>
                Looking at the Russian TF-IDF words in the Russian fairy tales, we can clearly see some regional words
                such as "tsarevich" which means the first prince of the kingdom. In this respect, it is similar to
                English fairy tales since "prince" is a word of high frequency in those fairy tales.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to typical English fairy tales. Russian fairy tales don't have as many animals as English
                fairy tales do. Instead, based on the words of high importance, the fairy tales are more related to
                human beings, and are usually more so to the royal members. For examples, the word king, prince,
                princess, and fool are very common. This could largely indicate the ancient word recorded fairy tales
                themes in Russia are largely distributed among royal settings.

                Indian TD-IDF Analysis
            </h3>
            <p>
                We do see some Indian only word such as "faja", or "fakir" which are names of Muslim religious. However,
                the Indian fairy tales share the same theme as the English and Russian fairy tales. Its jokes are mostly
                centered towards royal members such as kings and princes, and towards animals such as horses and dogs.
                It may occur that all over the world, the fairy tales are likely to include animals and royal animals
                due to those content's benign nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different from English and Russian fairy tales, the word "son" has a high importance in the Indian fairy
                tales. This may indicate the Asian background of the Indian fairy tales, where in ancient Asia, people
                are largely concerned about family heritage and therefore the fairy tales mention about father and son
                relationships.

        <p>
            The parallel coordinate graph gives the user a direct view of categorical linear data for all countries'
            fairy tales. On one hand, the user can notice that there are many level under that property. For example,
            for emotions, it could be happy => delighted => neutral => sad => mad in a line so that each axis will have
            different heat of color and give the user a vivid information about its meaning. On the other hand, the user
            will be able to track the lines for a certain country's fairy tale so that they will be able to see how
            countries do relatively well in a certain category.

            <p>
                Look at the graph for drives for the fairy tales. We can easily discover that Indian Fairy tales largely
                focus on drives, affiliation, achieve, power, and risk. This absolutely does not mean that Indian fairy
                tales focus on those things, but this does affect that Indian fairy tales use more words to reflect the
                individual motivations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Noticeably, the Indian fairy tales does not focus on the reward. Therefore, Indian fairy tales focus
                more on the process and achievement but not on the actual reward. We do notice that English fairy tales
                and Russian fairy tales have a similar pattern of drives. Ths probably mean that cultural wise the
                Russian fairy tales are more close to the English fairy tales than Indian fairy tales.

            <p>
                Look at this graph for concerns, we can see that Indian fairy tales focus considerably on religion and
                death, which indicate that Indian fairy tales have involved more scenes regarding super natural back
                ground and deity.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also discover that comparing to English fairy tales, Russian and Indian fairy tales are less home
                oriented. This as we also discovered in word list of high TF-IDF, indicates that Russian and Indian
                fairy tales probably have very different audiences. Instead of for the normal households, it implements
                the value of more educated and royal families.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Russian fairy tales focus more on leisure and work. This means that the background settings for
                Russian fairy tales are more towards the setting of leisure.

        <p>
            The connected scatter plots focus in the relationship between attributes (not entities). For example, if
            the document mentions boys and girls, the number of boys the story mentions may not give a meaningful
            explanation of the data set. However, if we use the number of boys as x axis and number of girls as y axis,
            then these two data together gives the user the idea of gender ratio in the data set. Moreover, connecting
            those dots from different scatter plots helps the user to track the ratio status of the same countries’
            fairy tale. The user just needs to follow the specific color of lines, to see all these ratios.

            Looking at the graph above, we are able to compare separately about property vectors of the fairy tales.
            From the data, we can see that Indian fairy tales generally have more male characters than English fairy
            tales and Russian fairy tales. This is largely due to that Indian cultures are more gender biased, so that
            their fairy tales have more characters like "princes" and "kings", instead of "little girl" or "wife".
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, we can see that English and Russian fairy tales are similar in regard to the way they depict their
            stories. However, Indian fairy tales, again, have more visual descriptions about objects than sensual. This
            might be that Indian fairy tales like to include scenes of environments instead of depicting feelings of
            characters. A larger data set of fairy tales is needed to make this conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also see similarities for those sets in our data. All those fairy tales are almost equally likely to
            write about the past as well as the future. This suggests that fairy tales across the world has an equal
            sense of chronic line. The reason for this is probably that those stories are fairy tales and are of equal
            amount of imagination regarding future and past. The future-to-past ratio is more determined by literature
            genres than by culture.
