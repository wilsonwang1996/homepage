<h2 class="title-parts">Overview and Motivation</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>This project aims to visualize the process where children pick up new vocabularies. Furthermore, it aims to give
    users a rough sketch of properties of those words, and allow users to relate the data to their own interest and have
    their own discovery about kids's vocabularies. Finally, not only will users take away interesting ideas from this
    visualization, but they can also download their exploration in a csv, and use it for future research.</p>
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Kaitlyn: I have a linguistics minor and overall love language, so doing something within the scope of
        linguistics was an automatic choice for me. I’m especially interested in language development, and think that
        being able to see the pace of reading development at a young age will be fun and informative.
    </li>
    <li>Wilson: I am doing quantitative finance where language process of news and articles could potentially create
        signals for asset pricing and impact trade decisions. In this project, I aim to collaborate with my teammate and
        work on analyzing and presenting data about linguistic factor time series. I will take advantage of this
        experience as using quantitative methods to explain about data sets, and effectively and artistically represent
        statistical results.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title-parts">Related Work</h2>
<p>
    Content-wise, we were inspired by the initial text analysis in class and the discussions on how. It made us more
    curious about the presentation of words to children and how their vocabulary stacked up against the real world in
    terms of how positive it was, how concrete it was, etc.
    Beyond that, knowing the importance of children developing a strong vocabulary piqued our interest because it's a
    life-changing issue, and there is plenty of media stressing its importance, like <a
        href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/69/5b/87695bd20265d5531ea3a0a28c5d9b1f.jpg">this one</a>, along with
    plenty of research and analysis (like the one we read <a
        href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1525740117702457">here</a>).
    The parallel coordinate libraries online are helpful since it provided insight in how to handle drag events in svg
    canvas. We also used handsomeform which is a non-commercial library allowing us to have spreadsheets presented on
    web pages. The general blog sites are helpful that we learned how to make our data downloadable based on user
    selection.
    Overall, the field of studying vocab development is young but burgeoning, and we were excited to explore it more and
    learn.

<h2 class="title-parts">Questions</h2>
<h3>Fundamental Questions As We Designed This Project</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        How fast are average kids learning words over time? How many words do they learn at each age?
    </li>
    <li>
        Of words learned at different ages, do they have different attributes? For example, as kids grow up, do they
        learn words that are more dominant?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions We Added in Milestone #1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are textbooks designed for kids from different age groups. How do words in those textbooks differ from
        each other?<br/>
        <b>We took out this question from our visualization in Milestone #2, for the reason below:</b><br/>
        It is really hard to define "how old" is a book. Typically adults wrote those book and they don't really reflect
        useful information about how kids learning words over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Are different attributes correlated with each other? Does the correlation between attributes change over time?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions We Added in Milestone #2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Can we find words by their prefix and suffix?
    </li>
    <li>
        How does attributes of words relate to age of learning?
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title-parts">Data</h2>
<h3>Source</h3>

    Sources are mostly from The Center for Reading Research in Belgium (who have international studies that are relevant
    universally to language learning). They’ve more or less done all the research and data acquisition and have plenty
    in spreadsheets.

<h3>Scraping Method</h3>
<p>
    None necessary!
</p>
<h3>Data Clean Up</h3>
<p>
    We merged our datasets and made a new csv with all the attributes for each word,
    eliminating words that didn't have complete data. For the later charts,
    we used a sampled subset of all words to reduce latency issues.

<p> Other Designs:
<ul>
    <li><a href=”https://slideplayer.com/slide/10144039/33/images/15/Language+Acquisition.jpg”>This</a> is one of the
        designs we mimicked, and while it is simple, we felt it effective because it shows the drastic rate of growth
        experienced in children’s vocabulary at the youngest of ages. Our scatterplot is in a way an extension of this
        one, as it prompted our interest in the continued rate of growth for vocab and informed our design by
        essentially letting us provide the extension of it.

        was another type of visualization we looked at, which more directly represented specific words. We thought about
        visualizing to that specificity, on a word level, but we realized that had far too many data points for them to
        be individually meaningful (along with the fact that we have integer ages rather than float averages). That’s
        part of why we decided to use the parallel coordinates spreadsheet generation as a way to show the data on a
        word level: we didn’t think a full graph beyond the words by age plot would add anything or be effective use of
        our visualization space as it would simply be too crowded, but we didn’t want to overlook the fact that users
        might want to see the actual words or use them as a word list.

</ul>

<h2 class="title-parts">Design Evolution</h2>
<h3 class="title-parts">Design Evolution - Sketches</h3>
<p>At the very first, we started off by drawing random charts on paper, the purpose of this is to have a pool of designs
    to pick from. Some designs look like this: (Very rough and ugly and motivate innovation: </p>

<a href="photos/sketchPool1.PNG" target="_blank">

</a>
<p>
    Based on those random thoughts, we generated a few valid page layouts.

<h3 class="title-parts">Design Evolution - Milestone #1</h3>
<p>During the stage of Milestone #1, we updated our sketch to add more details, and we recognized the functionalities of
    each
    parts. This process is crucial, so based on those plans we started to get our hands on a very rough
    visualization.</p>
<p>We divided our visualization into four parts, and we named them: "Words By Age Chart", "Word Child Chart", "Property
    Dictionary", and "Word AoA Overview". Note that we updated those names in our later designs, since those names are
    confusing, and users didn't know what to do with each part or understand their relations. Sketches for each part of
    our design:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        In the first chart, we designed a fan with clickable buttons. The purpose of this chart is to allow users to
        click on that fan and based on the clicks, it will show data in the center of the fan. It was designed to let
        user find a word by initial letters, and then see the property of that word selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the second chart, we have two layouts. The first one shows the number of words kids learn over time. The
        second
        chart keeps track of the growth rate. Then there is a column, which contains statistical data of selected words.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the third chart, we are able to show customized plots. On the pane on the left, users can select properties
        of their interests. And the system would generate either a bar graph if user wants one dimension, or a
        scatter plot if users select two dimensions. This chart shows the attributes of words over time, and how
        attributes might correlate to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the fourth chart, we use a parallel coordinate plot to let user brush on multiple properties. Based on their
        selection, they will be able to download words of their choice. They can also examine the color of graph and see
        how words of different age may have certain properties.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that, at Milestone #1, we decided to have our future design functional based on this
    framework. It didn't not deviate from our initial sketch. We just picked our best designs and put them into
    plan and work.</p>
<p>Following our plans we made during initial design. We finished the draft for two of four parts, which are the first
    and third parts of the graphics. They were functional, and look like this:</p>
<a href="photos/milestone1design1.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/milestone1design1.PNG" height="200" width="320" alt="pic">

<a href="photos/milestone1design4.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/milestone1design4.PNG" height="200" width="320" alt="pic">
</a>
<p>The graphics above set up examples about how we can: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Do brush selections in chart 1 on the word count, and highlight the corresponding growth rates.</li>
    <li>Do brush selections in chart 3 on parallel coordinates, and show a spreadsheet of selected data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We found some potential problems during our talk with other groups about Milestone #1, which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Overall, chart 1 seems too simple, but given that the data is simple as well, we decided to add tooltips and
        make the graphics look better in our final.
    </li>
    <li>
        The parallel coordinate looks the same as the project we did in class (tho we did in another language), but this
        doesn't mean this design is innovative enough. So we decide to add things and convey more data in this chart by
        adding colors to words of different ages.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="title-parts">Design Evolution - Milestone #2</h3>
<p>For Milestone #2, we set up the full framework for the project. The goal for this stage is to have the graphics
    functional
    (but not necessarily artistic) in order to best get feedback on the core of the visualizations. Based on
    this design we generated ideas for the final visualization. Below, I will explain about each part of our design,
    and how it evolute from our initial designs.</p>
<ul>
    <li><br/>
        <a href="photos/milestone2NaviBar.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2NaviBar.PNG" alt="pic">
        </a>
        <p>We added this navigation bar because originally we had our charts all on one page, and since there are
            too much content, they barely fit into that page. Also, since we wanted to work independently on our
            respective designs,
            we wanted to better facilitate conflict-free development. </p>
        <p>A potential problem is that when this navigation bar loads initially, there is a lag and shapes showing up on
            the page. So this needs to be optimized.</p>
    </li>
    <li><br/>
        <a href="photos/milestone2Scatter.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2Scatter.PNG" alt="pic" width="800" height="400">
        </a>
        <p>
            Our scatter plot functions pretty well. On the top there is a bar allows us to select timeline of our
            desire. On the left is the selection pane and on the bottom is the scatter plot.
        </p>
        <p>The problem with this design is that right now it looks monotone and simplistic. To add more variations, more
            tool tips can
            be added, and we can also update the page layout to make it look better.</p>
    </li>
    <li><br/>
        <a href="photos/milestone2ParallelCoordinate.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2ParallelCoordinate.PNG" alt="pic" width="800" height="400">
        </a>
        <p>In this chart, we improvide the old design by adding colors to each line, representing the age of acquisition
            of that word. We also added a clear button, so that all brushes can easily be erased. We also optimized the
            code by slicing the data, so the page loads faster.</p>
        <p>
            The problem with this design is that it might be too complex for people to understand and the lines look
            kinda messy. To solve this problem, we need to do a clean up and hopefully find a better design than
            parallel coordinate for our charts layouts.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><br/>
        <a href="photos/milestone2GrowthChart.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2GrowthChart.PNG" alt="pic" width="800" height="400">
        </a>
        <p>This chart is pretty much identical to Milestone #1 since the focus was on developing functionality for our
            second half of visualizations.
            Nevertheless, a great improvement is that this chart now has tooltips and it helps guide the users towards
            understanding our data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to make the graphics look better. Again, this can be pushed over to after the dry run, in which we
            can get advice from peers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><br/>
        <a href="photos/milestone2FanChart.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2FanChart.PNG" alt="pic" width="400" height="400">
        </a>
        <a href="photos/milestone2FanChart2.PNG" target="_blank">
            <img src="photos/milestone2FanChart2.PNG" alt="pic" width="400" height="400">
        </a>
        <p>
            In this fan chart, users first click on the first letter, then the second, to find the collection of words,
            complete with a spinning animation.
            On the top, there is a line keeping track of which level the user is at.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many things I can do to improve this chart. First, I should make it clear that clicking on middle
            of the fan would return to last level. I'm planning to add a button here. Second, this fan looks ugly when
            too many words fit into too little space. I'll take the words out of the fan and put them elsewhere so the
            users can easily see it. Third, right now this chart does not connect with other charts very closely. I'm
            adding a tooltip to it so that it allows users to get meaningful results when doing a search. Fourth, some
            users may not like to use the pane to search, so I would add a separate search bar for this function.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="title-parts">Design Evolution - User Testing</h3>
<p>We took all of our user testing into consideration, and many of our adjustments are clear responses to our user
    testing feedback and observations. Therefore, we felt it valuable to include our notes:</p>
<p>
    A:
<ul>
    <li>Need larger dots on main scatterplot so it’s easier to hover
    <li>Add hover to deriv chart
    <li>One user didn’t realize you could brush, one did immediately (we were assuming the standard brush cursor would
        make that obvious)
    <li>No issues in interpretation for any elements, related tasks were completed effortlessly
</ul>
B:
<ul>
    <li> Need clearer definitions/more visible hovering
    <li>Brush is a little sloppy, should start with everything highlighted and adjustable bars
    <li>No immediate feedback on brush above since scatterplots don’t generate until axes are chosen, should probably at
        least prompt the users
    <li>One user wasn’t sure what X and Y meant until he generated a plot
    <li>Scatterplot trends weren’t necessarily easy to pick up from just eyeing it, maybe providing a best fit line
        would help?
    <li>Stretch goal thought, if multiple years are selected, provide an animate option that goes through each year on
        the scatterplot?
    <li>Percentage known seems useless (since prevalence is related anyways and provides a more spaced out measure), we
        should probably get rid of it
</ul>
C:
<ul>
    <li>Some struggling with brushing/being able to see the option to do so
    <li>Sought a way to see a specific line on the chart from the spreadsheet
    <li>Wanted a way to find a specific word - search-like functionality
    <li>Trying to click off of brushed area to remove a specific axis brush
    <li>Clearing the brush takes a while, users thought it might be broken
</ul>
D:
<ul>
    <li>Users weren’t sure how to move backwards a step
    <li>Need some kind of feedback about where we are
    <li>Weren’t sure of the point
</ul>

Overall:
No one noted general latency as a problem, though there is some

</p>
<h3 class="title-parts">Design Evolution - Milestone#3</h3>
(See in Implementation for our current design, its functionality, and improvements from older versions)
<h2 class="title-parts">Implementation</h2>
<h3>Favicon</h3>
<a href="photos/finalFavicon.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalFavicon.png" alt="pic">
</a>
<p>We added a kid's favicon to add more spice to our page. Now it looks more like a legitimate web page.</p>
<h3>Color Theme and Page Layout</h3>
<a href="photos/finalPageLayout.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalPageLayout.png" alt="pic" width="800" height="100">
</a>
<p>
    We updated page layout so that we follow a strict color theme and all elements on the page thus look more
    harmonious.
    We use three colors which are purple, blue, and green of different lightness. A great improvement from the old
    navigation bar since now the buttons looks clickable, and we also have shorter and clearer names for parts of our
    graph which indicates their functionality.
</p>

<h3>Growth Chart
</h3>
<a href="photos/finalGrowthChart.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalGrowthChart.PNG" alt="pic" height="400">
</a>
<p>
    Since one of our biggest problems was the oversimplicity of the main display, we've supplemented it more than a
    little.
    The new and improved main chart has images of children whose heights match up to the line graph at the approximate
    age they represent.
    We don't believe this is pure chart junk since it does provide some contextualization of age ranges besides numbers.
    Additionally, we supplemented our data further by adding milestone information for whichever age is highlighted.
    While not directly
    related to the children's vocab, we believe that it is important to have some kind of context for what the child's
    life state is like
    at any given age in order to fully understand how their language is developing.
    Additionally, we made the dots bigger on both scatterplots since it was proving difficult to get the tooltip, along
    with adding tooltips to the growth chart.
    The functionality is otherwise the same as previous iterations since it was clear and caused no problems during user
    testing.
</p>

<h3>Attributes Chart
</h3>
<a href="photos/finalAttributesChartEmpty.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalAttributesChartEmpty.PNG" alt="pic" height="400">
</a>
<p>
    Our second chart is designed to let users see trends in the attributes of words over different periods of time.
    They can select dimensions to produce a graph of their choosing, along with an age or age range to filter the plots.
    Since a point of confusion was what some dimension names meant,
    there are new and improved tooltips upon hovering over the names.
    We reorganized the layout and moved the age selection area to the bottom since it was a point of confusion, along
    with adding a prompt to select a dimension.
</p>
<a href="photos/finalAttributesChartBar.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalAttributesChartBar.PNG" alt="pic" height="400">
</a>
<p>
    If users select one dimension or two of the same dimension, a dynamically scaled bar graph is created.
</p>
<a href="photos/finalAttributesChartScatter.PNG" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalAttributesChartScatter.PNG" alt="pic" height="400">
</a>
<p>
    If users select two unique dimensions, a scatterplot with their selected x and y axis is generated.
    Both here and in the bar graph case, we realized that eying a trend would be difficult, so we added the statistics
    to the side
    showing the average value of each dimension and the change over the selected age range (e.g. concreteness goes down
    over a point between ages 2 and 12, indicating a trend towards the abstract).
    We feel like this makes it far easier for users to see a trend if there is one.
</p>

<h3>Search Chart
</h3>
<a href="photos/finalSearchChart.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="photos/finalSearchChart.png" alt="pic" width="800" height="400">
</a>
<p>
    This search chart is consisted of a search pane, which allows users to click to find the words they want to see; a
    search bar which allows users to type in key words and find words with suffix or prefix; a babble graph which shows
    all the research results; and tool tip for each word.
    We switched from simply showing the words on the fan chart to a babble graph because a) it looks far more
    aesthetically pleasing,
    b) the words are easier to read when right side up, c) it allows a separate typed search functionality, and
    d) it's far more forgiving when you want to check multiple letter combinations since the results aren't combined
    with the search in the same graphic.

    The search pane now only has two layers: "First Letter" and "First Two Letters". The words will show in the babble
    chart instead. This is because for some initials, there are too many words and they don't exactly fit into a pane.
    Moreover, some users may prefer to type instead of click, or they want to find words by suffix/prefix, so they can
    use the search bar instead. The center of pane is now shown as a button and thus clickable.

    I'm using the system default tooltip. The advantage is that it fits better with generic user interface and look
    natural (not an annoying window following your mouse around). When the mouse hoover over babbles, there would be a
    loading sign indicating the user needs to wait 3 seconds for the default tooltip to show up.

<p>In this download chart, the user can see a box graph of attribute distribution over the whole data set. If they want
    to see more detailed distribution for properties, they can shift to "Attribute" tab to see more. The box chart
    allows the user to use brush tool and narrow down the selection. Since box chart shows where the data mainly at, it
    provides a good assist for the user to know where most data is at.</p>

<p>
    There is a handle for the brush, and the handle is totally clickable. It's an effective
    add-on to the visualization since it tells users to drag the thing. (Yes, wherever there is a
    button/handle, you want to touch it; even babies understand this rule).

<p>
    There is a line showing the average age of data selected, which changes as users adjust the brushes. This can
    attract their attention, and they may find some useful information or key takeaway from the data set.

<p>
    There is a download button showing how many entries are in the data set. By clicking on it, the user can download
    the data they selected. This feature is crucial. The user may have some intent for the data, effectively a
    vocabulary set,
    and want to use it for whatever reasons. By allowing them to have the data, the key takeaway to users will be more
    than memory but useful spreadsheet to do research in the future.

<h3>Key takeaways from our dataset</h3>
<p>Generally, we had a broad view about our data set through our visualization. The most interesting factors include not
    exclusively to factors as below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The growth rate of vocabulary size for kids are almost constant over the years. However, at the age of 6, and
        12, there is a significant faster learning rate. This noticably are also years where kids graduate from primary
        school and middle school, so our guess is the education system has effected kids' vocabulary in nonobservable
        ways. (Maybe kids learn harder when they try to apply for good middle/high schools?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Kids learn less concrete and less positive words as they grow up. This is probably because they started to write
        about more sophisticated subjects.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is not much correlation between attributes of words, for different age groups (save between valence and
        dominance).
        This surprised us, as we were expecting some kind of relationship, but this shows the users that
        the attributes we chose to present are independent of each other and are effective in giving a broad range of
        dimensions
        through which users can explore the data.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fundamental Questions As We Designed This Project</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        How fast are average kids learning words over time? How many words do they learn at each age?
    </li>
    <li>
        Of words learned at different ages, do they have different attributes? For example, as kids grow up, do they
        learn words that are more dominant?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>How we answered our questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Q: How fast are average kids learning words over time? How many words do they learn at each age?
        <br \>A: In the "Growth" chart, we showed the word growth rate over time on the right. There are also a column
        with statistics showing the numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Q: Of words learned at different ages, do they have different attributes? For example, as kids grow up, do they
        learn words that are more dominant?
        <br \>A: Short answer is "yes". Long answer is, "Go find out by yourself" in "Attribute" chart. If you want to
        find dominant, you can select "dominance" for both x and y axis, and you can see the distribution in the bar
        chart.
    </li>
    <li>
        Q: Are different attributes correlated with each other? Does the correlation between attributes change over
        time?
        <br \>A: No, not very correlated. You can see this by selecting different attributes as x and y axis, then you
        can see the correlations in the scatter plot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Q: Can we find words by their prefix and suffix?
        <br \>A: Yes, in the "Search" chart, you can type in the search bar, and click search button to do the search.
    </li>
    <li>
        Q: How does attributes of words relate to age of learning?
        <br \>A: Good question. You can see that in "Attribute" chart, where you specify age ranges, then select the
        attribute you want to see for both x and y axises. When you drag the age range, you see the trend.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Our visualization functions pretty well. However, if the linguistic scientists come up with much larger and
    comprehensive databases of kids' word learning, we will need to change the visualization tools to represent that
    data, and find ways to handle the delays.</p>
