A series of visualizations meant to explore the rate and attributes of vocabulary development for children ages 2 to 14. It consists of 4 main views:
* Growth: Scatterplots and statistics used to represent contextualized information about the rate of vocabulary growth
  * Tooltips available for all data points
  * Brushing the main scatterplot updates the side one
* Attributes: A user-directed graph generator that allows users to select dimensions to create graphs and see the trends over time
  * Selecting 1 dimension creates a bar graph, 2 dimensions creates a scatterplot
  * Can be filtered by age by brushing below
* Search: A user-directed tool to look at words and their attributes with given prefixes or manual search
* Download: A filterable tool that lets people generate vocabulary list with their given specifications
  * All dimensions are customizeable, updating the spreadsheet contents in real time
  * Hitting the download button after generating a word list allows people to use the filtered csv file
