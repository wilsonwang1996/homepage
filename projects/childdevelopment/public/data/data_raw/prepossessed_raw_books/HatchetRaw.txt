pilot pushed rudder pedal plane jerked side assumed new
course brian could remember much pulled around wouldnt much
pilot dead brian flown hour hour new course
well away flight plan pilot filed many hour maybe mile hour even
little course speed time brian might sitting several hundred mile
side recorded flight plan
would probably search heavily first along flight plan course might go
side little could easily three four hundred mile side could know could
think far might flown wrong didnt know original course didnt
know much pulled sideways
quite bit thats remembered quite jerk side pulled head sharply
plane swung around
might find two three day
felt heartbeat increase fear started thought fought

next thought well might never find panic
fought tried stay positive searched hard plane went used
many men plane would go side would know flight
path talked man radio would somehow know

two year terry fooling around near park city seemed
end time tree grew thick came small river went park
thick seemed kind wild joking making thing
pretended lost wood talked afternoon would
course figured theyd sort goody like gun knife fishing gear match
could hunt fish fire
wish terry thought gun knife match
park time decided best shelter leanto brian set make
one maybe cover grass leaf stick thought started go
lake willow could cut brace struck
ought find good place leanto decided look around first wanted stay
near lake thought plane even deep water might show somebody
flying didnt want diminish chance might found
eye fell upon stone ridge left thought first build shelter
stone decided check far side ridge got
lucky
using sun fact rose east set west decided far side
northern side ridge one time far past scooped something probably
glacier scooping left kind sideways bowl back ledge wasnt deep
cave smooth made perfect roof could almost stand ledge
hold head slightly tipped forward front keep hitting die top
rock scooped also pulverized glacial action turned sand
made small sand beach went edge water front right
overhang
first good luck
thought good luck landing good luck well luck needed
wall part bowl leave opening doorway would
perfect shelter much stronger leanto dry overhang made watertight roof
crawled back die ledge sat sand cool shade die coolness
felt wonderful face already starting blister get especially painful forehead
blister top swelling
also still weak die walk around back ridge slight climb top
left leg rubbery felt good sit bit die shade overhang cool sand
thought something eat
anything
rested bit went back lake drank couple swallow water
wasnt thirsty thought water might help take edge hunger didnt
somehow cold lake water actually made worse sharpened
thought dragging wood make wall part overhang picked one piece
pull arm weak knew wasnt crash injury
body head also weak hunger
would find something eat anything else would something
eat

tail inside plane rip cut way however would need operating
base kind raft
found ruefully much easier said done plenty log around
shore littered driftwood new old tossed scattered tornado
simple matter find four length pull together
keeping together problem without rope crosspiece nail log rolled
separated tried wedging together crossing nothing seemed
work needed stable platform get job done becoming frustrating
momentary loss temper would done past person

sense thats took solve problem sense
came log selected smooth round limb
needed log limb sticking could cross limb one log limb
another weave together done wall food shelf cover fish gate
scanned area beach found four dry treetop broken storm
limb dragged work area water edge fitted
together
took day limb cluttered stuck way would cut
one make another fit cut one another log come back first one still another
third log would pulled
last late afternoon done raft called brushpile one
look hung together even pulled water beach floated well low
water excitement started plane could stand would
swim alongside
chest depth realized way keep raft plane needed
way tie place could work
moment stymied rope bowstring cut shoestring

kickswimming toward tail plane
hard going eddy breeze came seemed
standing still time close enough tail see rivet aluminum

perhaps half elevator short piece top fuselage plane body
toward tail water curve aluminum first could see place
tie raft pulled along elevator end found gap went
hinge could feed rope
raft secure climbed top lay back fifteen minute resting letting

strong started
somehow get inside plane opening even small rear cargo hatch
underwater couldnt get without diving coming inside plane
would trapped
shuddered thought remembered front die plane
bottom lake still strapped seat body tile pilot sitting water brian
could see big man hair waving current eye open

even candy bar would worth
get inside plane
rolled raft pulled around plane opening three time put face
water opened eye looked water murky could see perhaps six
foot obvious way get plane blocked

brian worked around tail plane two time pulling along stabilizer
elevator simply wasnt way
stupid thought stupid think could come get inside plane nothing
easy place nothing easy
slammed fist body plane complete surprise aluminum covering

well thought expect easy easy way open get
pack right
would open much could poke inside see could
find survival pack zippered nylon bag perhaps canvas kind thought
red gray well didnt matter must moved plane
crashed might jammed something else
started chopping cutting aluminum away small triangle putting one raft
chopped could never throw anything away thought might useful
later bit metal fish arrowhead lure maybe finally finished
cleaned away whole side top fuselage stuck water cut
water far could reach hole almost big except crossed
crisscrossed aluminum might steel couldnt tell brace former cable
awful tangled mess chopping brace away room wiggle
get inside
held back moment uncomfortable thought getting inside plane
