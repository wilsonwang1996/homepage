actually christmas wasnt far away
thats always good topic
conversation one subject
kept coming back toâsecurity
security
gotten wherever marshall left
hiding place beneath altar
set written
message dozen
theory le realistic
depending mood moment
time
favored practical theory
kid might found game
tried funny time went
one burst gloat
successful trick seemed
le le likely someone
group might guilty
toby first one
would confess didnt
seem reasonable
support conclusion sort
man toby seen
alleyâbut one could come
even slightly reasonable explanation
could
known oracle
course subject murder
murderer came often
still throughout neighborhood
still unsolved mystery
terribly real dangerous one
fortunately seemed
logical reason believe
mystery could connection
mystery oracle would
murderer fool around writing message
missing toy seemed
possible answer
time afternoon
almost disturbing shadow
crept across storage yard different
kind theory went round
somebody brought story
curse king tut pointed
lot people actually believed
mysterious magic power day
pharaoh strong enough
terrible thing anyone stirred
somehow
ceremony thing theyd managed
stumble way stirring
thing like
happened everyone read something
seen something tv like
began remember strange
thing happened

stone sure shed felt move
finger another time
toby gotten egypt early
alone hed strangest feeling
someone watching
got going sort
thing story
