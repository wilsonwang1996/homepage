quietness especially wood already told also bilbo slipped ring
started spider neither saw heard coming
picked way stealthily distance noticed place dense black shadow
ahead black even forest like patch midnight never cleared away
drew nearer saw made spiderwebs one behind tangled another
suddenly saw spider huge horrible sitting branch
ring ring trembled fear lest discover standing behind tree watched
group time silence stillness wood realised
loathsome creature speaking one another voice sort thin creaking
hissing could make many word said talking dwarf

marched grey silent cliff foot ravenhill river winding wide
loop valley dale turned mountain road lake flowing swift
noisily bank bare rocky tall steep stream gazing
narrow water foaming splashing among many boulder could see wide valley
shadowed mountain arm grey ruin ancient house tower wall
lie left dale said balin mountain side green wood
sheltered valley rich pleasant day bell rang town looked
sad grim said one thorins companion day dragon came
dare follow river much towards gate went beyond
end southern spur lying hidden behind rock could look see dark
cavernous opening great cliff wall arm mountain water
running river sprang came steam dark smoke nothing moved
waste save vapour water every black ominous crow
sound sound stony water every harsh croak bird balin

dragon still alive hall mountain thenâ imagine
smoke said hobbit

away time might lying mountainside keeping watch still expect
smoke steam would come gate hall within must filled foul reek
gloomy thought followed ever croaking crow made weary way
back camp june guest fair house elrond though autumn
crawling towards winter pleasant time seemed year ago alone
perilous waste without hope help end journey far ever
seemed end quest none much spirit left
strange say mr baggins others would often borrow thorins map
gaze pondering rune message moonletters elrond read
made dwarf begin dangerous search western slope secret door
moved camp long valley narrower great dale south gate
river stood walled lower spur mountain two thrust forward west
main mass long steepsided ridge fell ever downwards towards plain
western side fewer sign dragon marauding foot grass
pony western camp shadowed day cliff wall sun began sink towards
forest day day toiled party searching path mountainside map
true somewhere high cliff valley head must stand secret door day day
came back camp without success
last unexpectedly found seeking fili kili hobbit went back
one day valley scrambled among tumbled rock southern corner
midday creeping behind great stone stood alone like pillar bilbo came looked like
rough step going upwards following excitedly dwarf found trace narrow
track often lost often rediscovered wandered top southern ridge brought
last still narrower ledge turned north across face mountain booking
saw top cliff valley head gazing
camp silently clinging rocky wall right went single file along
ledge till wall opened turned little steepwalled bay grassyfloored still
quiet entrance found could seen overhang
cliff small looked like dark crack
cave open sky inner end flat wall rose lower part
close ground smooth upright mason work without joint crevice
seen sign post lintel threshold sign bar bolt keyhole yet
doubt found door last
beat thrust pushed implored move spoke fragment
broken spell opening nothing stirred last tired rested grass foot
evening began long climb
excitement camp night morning prepared move
bofur bombur left behind guard pony store brought
river others went valley newly found path narrow
ledge along could carry bundle pack narrow breathless fall
hundred fifty foot beside sharp rock took good coil rope
wound tight waist last without mishap reached little grassy bay
made third camp hauling needed rope

exchange news take share guard bofur hauled
higher camp bombur would come either rope path
fat flywalks said turn dizzy tread beard
would thirteen knotted rope slender weight luckily
true see
meanwhile explored ledge beyond opening found path led
higher higher mountain dare venture far way
much use silence reigned broken bird sound except wind
cranny stone spoke low never called sang danger brooded every rock
others busy secret door success eager trouble
rune moonletters tried without resting discover exactly smooth
face rock door hidden brought pick tool many sort laketown
first tried use struck stone handle splintered jarred
arm cruelly steel head broke bent like lead mining work saw clearly
good magic shut door grew terrified echoing noise
bilbo found sitting doorstep lonesome wearisomeâ doorstep course
really used call little grassy space wall opening doorstep
fun remembering bilbos word long ago unexpected party hobbithole said
could sit doorstep till thought something sit think wandered
aimlessly glummer glummer became
spirit risen little discovery path sank boot
yet would give go away hobbit longer much brighter dwarf
would nothing sit back rockface stare away west opening
cliff wide land black wall mirkwood distance beyond

bear see unhappy valley dale steaming gate
night miserable hardly slept next day dwarf went wandering
various direction exercising pony roving
mountainside day bilbo sat gloomily grassy bay gazing stone west
narrow opening queer feeling waiting something perhaps wizard
suddenly come back today thought
lifted head could see glimpse distant forest sun turned west
gleam yellow upon far roof light caught last pale leaf soon saw orange
ball sun sinking towards level eye went opening pale faint
thin new moon rim earth
moment heard sharp crack behind grey stone grass
enormous thrush nearly coal black pale yellow breast freckled dark spot crack
caught snail knocking stone crack crack
suddenly bilbo understood forgetting danger stood ledge hailed dwarf
shouting waving nearest came tumbling rock fast could
along ledge wondering earth matter others shouted hauled
rope except bombur course asleep
quickly bilbo explained fell silent hobbit standing grey stone
dwarf wagging beard watching impatiently sun sank lower lower hope
fell sank belt reddened cloud disappeared dwarf groaned still bilbo stood
almost without moving little moon dipping horizon evening coming
suddenly hope lowest red ray sun escaped like finger rent
cloud gleam light came straight opening bay fell smooth rock
face old thrush watching high perch beady eye head cocked
one side gave sudden trill loud crack flake rock split wall fell
hole appeared suddenly three foot ground
quickly trembling lest chance fade dwarf rushed rock pushedâ
vain
key key cried bilbo thorin
thorin hurried
key shouted bilbo key went map try still time
thorin stepped drew key chain round neck put hole
fitted turned snap gleam went sun sank moon gone evening sprang
sky
pushed together slowly part rockwall gave way long straight crack
appeared widened door five foot high three broad outlined slowly without sound
swung inwards seemed darkness flowed like vapour hole mountainside
deep darkness nothing could seen lay eye yawning mouth leading

uncomfortable stood one leg others made pretence offeringâ except old balin
lookout man rather fond hobbit said would come inside least perhaps
bit way ready call help necessary
said dwarf intended pay bilbo really handsomely
service brought nasty job mind poor little
fellow would would done best get trouble got

great idea value money tricky treacherous pretty bad lot
decent enough people like thorin company dont expect much

nature folk thoroughly perplexed began grumble hobbit blaming
first pleased bringing away cup stirring smaug wrath soon
else suppose burglar asked bilbo angrily engaged kill
dragon warrior work steal treasure made best beginning could expect
trot back whole hoard thror back grumbling done
think might say ought brought five hundred burglar one sure
reflects great credit grandfather cannot pretend ever made vast extent
wealth clear want hundred year bring fifty time big

inexperienced bilbo course ought guard smaug rather
overwhelming personality

bitter enemy
smaug really laughâ devastating sound shook bilbo floor far

impenetrable magnificence posse waistcoat fine diamond
yes rare wonderful indeed said smaug absurdly pleased know
hobbit already caught glimpse peculiar undercovering previous visit
itching closer view reason dragon rolled look said

tunnel
unfortunate remark dragon spouted terrific flame fast though
sped slope gone nearly far enough comfortable ghastly head
smaug thrust opening behind luckily whole head jaw could squeeze
nostril sent forth fire vapour pursue nearly overcome stumbled
blindly great pain fear feeling rather pleased cleverness
conversation smaug mistake end shook better sense
never laugh live dragon bilbo fool said became favourite saying
later passed proverb arent nearly adventure yet added
pretty true well
afternoon turning evening came stumbled fell faint

mountain companion followed hood cloak gone
shining armour red light leapt eye gloom great dwarf gleamed like gold
dying fire
rock hurled high goblin held leapt
fall foot rushed forward battle wolf rider fell fled thorin wielded
axe mighty stroke nothing seemed harm
elf men kinsfolk cried voice shook like horn
valley
heedless order rushed dwarf dain help came many
lakemen bard could restrain upon side came many spearmen
elf goblin stricken valley piled heap till dale
dark hideous corps wargs scattered thorin drove right
bodyguard bolg could pierce rank
already behind among goblin dead lay many men many dwarf many fair elf
lived yet long age merrily wood valley widened onset grew
ever slower number flank unguarded soon attacker attacked
forced great ring facing every way hemmed goblin wolf
returning assault bodyguard bolg came howling drove upon
rank like wave upon cliff sand friend could help assault
mountain renewed redoubled force upon either side men elf slowly
beaten
bilbo looked misery taken stand ravenhill among elvesâ partly
chance escape point partly tookish part
mind going last desperate stand preferred whole defend
elvenking gandalf may say sitting ground deep thought
preparing suppose last blast magic end
seem far long thought bilbo goblin win
gate slaughtered driven captured really enough make one weep
one gone would rather old smaug left wretched treasure
vile creature get poor old bombur balin fili kili
rest come bad end bard lakemen merry elf misery
heard song many battle always understood defeat may glorious seems
uncomfortable say distressing wish well
cloud torn wind red sunset slashed west seeing sudden gleam
gloom bilbo looked round gave great cry seen sight made heart leap dark
shape small yet majestic distant glow
eagle eagle shouted eagle coming
bilbos eye seldom wrong eagle coming wind line line
host must gathered eyry north
eagle eagle bilbo cried dancing waving arm elf could see
could hear soon took cry echoed across valley many wondering
eye looked though yet nothing could seen except southern shoulder
mountain
eagle cried bilbo moment stone hurtling smote
heavily helm fell crash knew
